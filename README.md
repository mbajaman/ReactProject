# Introduction
This is a native app created using ```React Native``` and ```Expo XDE```. It can be run on an android phone (by installing the Expo app) or through ```Genymotion``` (setting up a virtual phone).
This is a sort of 'To-Do' app where users can save information which can later be referred to as a reminder. It uses GPA tracking to save location of where the note was created and users can add images, title and notes to that specific entry. The entry is saved on storage and can be accessed and viewed on a later date.
